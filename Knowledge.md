### Supply Chain Q&A — 5 Questions

**Q1: Where does HS Timber Group source its raw materials?**
We source our timber from sustainably managed forests across Central and Eastern Europe. Every log is fully traceable — from the forest of origin to our production facilities. We maintain long-term partnerships with certified forest managers in Romania, Finland, and Ukraine, ensuring responsible forestry practices.

**Q2: How do you ensure sustainable forestry practices?**
Sustainability is built into every stage of our operations. We hold FSC and PEFC chain-of-custody certifications, conduct regular third-party audits, and invest in forest regeneration programs. Our annual sustainability report details our carbon footprint reduction targets and reforestation efforts.

**Q3: What certifications do your products carry?**
Our products carry FSC and PEFC chain-of-custody certifications, CE marking for structural timber, and meet EN 14081 grading standards. Specific products also carry fire resistance ratings and additional national certifications depending on the destination market.

**Q4: What is your average delivery timeline?**
Standard products are available within 5–10 business days for European markets. Intercontinental shipments typically require 4–6 weeks. We offer just-in-time delivery schedules for large construction projects with pre-negotiated volumes.

**Q5: Do you offer custom dimensions and specifications?**
Yes. Our manufacturing facilities are equipped for custom cutting, planing, and profiling. Minimum order quantities apply for custom specifications. Contact our sales team for a detailed quote — we typically turn around custom orders within 15–20 business days.
